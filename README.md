# Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project
Week Eight and first group project in Skill Distillery Full Stack Dev bootcamp. This was the first group project of the program.

## Key Skills
This project built off of the Film Query App assignment of Week 7, as well as concepts introduced in Week 8.

1. JDBC/ mySQL integration
2. full web-based CRUD functionality
3. DAO Implementation
4. remote group collaboration
5. pair programming
5. Spring MVC
6. JavaBeans

## Usage
This project allows the user to access a mySQL database of films.

The user can enter a film and see details about that film in a web page.

The user can also add films to the database, edit existing records, and delete films they added from the database.

The user is also able to search for films by keyword. From there, they can choose to edit, delete a film, or return to the main menu.

User can choose to add a new film and enter all properties of the film. Our DAO implementation then saves this information to the database. User also has the option to delete films they added from the database. User can search films from the database by keyword, then update or delete from the resulting list.


## Known Bugs
Features associated with User Story 4 and 6 are still in production. 
There is an error on mapping the JSP to the HTML film and getting the values of the HTML file and SQL to match.
